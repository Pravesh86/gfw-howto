<h3>Visualize global data on the GFW Interactive Map</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Navigate to the <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map" target="_blank">GFW Interactive Map</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  Available global data layers are organized by category across the top of the map. Click through the tabs to select the data layer(s) you want to display. Tree cover loss and gain are displayed by default.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>  Click the information icon in the drop down menu to learn more about each data layer. This includes information such as data resolution, frequency, cautions, and a link to learn more or download the data set on the <a class="mobile-friendly" href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/" target="_blank">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong>  View activated layers in the data legend on the left-hand side of the map.</p>
![alt text][desktop3]
<p>For data layers that cover a limited geographic region, you can turn on “Geographic coverage” in the data legend to see the geographic extent of the data layer on the map.</p>

<p>For tree cover and tree cover loss data layers, you can adjust the tree canopy density of your data display and analysis by clicking on the highlighted percent canopy density within the legend.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong>  Zoom in and out, share your map view, hide the windows, search the Google base map, and refresh the page using the buttons located on the bottom left-hand side of the map.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong>  Change the base map to view data with a different map background.</p>

<h3>Visualize data as a time series</h3>
<p>For most data layers under the Forest Change tab, the default view shows cumulative data points over the entire study period. However, most of these layers can also be viewed as a time series. The specific time intervals (e.g., annual, monthly, daily) vary for each data layer.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Select the Forest Change data layer you want to view as a time series.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  On the bottom of the map, locate the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  Some timelines allow you to animate the data over time or select a time interval. Press the play button on the left to view an animation of the entire time series or drag the ends of the timeline to select a specific period of time.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong>  For data layers with a simple timeline, select the period for which you would like to view data.</p>

<h3>Learn more about individual data points and polygons</h3>
<p>Some data layers allow you to click on individual data points and polygons (i.e., shapes) to view additional information. This feature applies to NASA active fires (within the Forest Change tab) and/or data within the Forest Use, Conservation, People, and Stories tabs.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Select a data layer, noting that this feature only applies to certain layers (see above).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  Click on the data point or polygon you want to learn more about and an information window will appear. <i>Note: You can analyze Forest Change data within individual land-use concessions and protected areas by selecting the analysis button in the information window. Click the <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/howto/analyze-forest-change" target='_blank'>Analyze Forest Change</a> tab on this page for step-by-step guidance.</i></p>
