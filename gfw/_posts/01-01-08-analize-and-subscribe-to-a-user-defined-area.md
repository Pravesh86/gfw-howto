Please be aware that not all alert systems may cover the area you selected, and not all forest change data sets are supported by the subscription feature. To learn more about each system, click on the information icons that appear in Forest Change drop-down menu on the GFW Interactive Map.</p>
      <p>To view and manage your subscriptions, click on <strong>“Visit your saved subscriptions”</strong> in the “Subscription saved” pop-up window, or click on “Subscriptions” in the drop-down menu from the My GFW icon.</p>

  <h3>Visualize data for different time periods</h3>
  <p>For most data layers under the Forest Change tab, the default view shows cumulative data points over the entire study period. However, most of these layers can also be viewed for other specified time periods. The specific time intervals (e.g., annual, monthly, and daily) vary for each data layer.</p>
  <p><strong>1.</strong>  Select the Forest Change data layer you want to view.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong>  On the bottom of the map, locate the timeline and select the period for which you would like to view data.</p>
  <p><%= image_tag('howto-screenshots-mobile/img17.png') %></p>

  <h3>Learn more about individual data points and polygons</h3>
  <p>Some data layers allow you to click on individual data points and polygons (i.e., shapes) to view additional information.</p>
  <p><strong>1.</strong>  Select a data layer(s) under the Global Data and Country Data tabs.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong>  Tap on the data point or polygon you want to learn more about and an information window will appear.</p>
