  <p><strong>2.</strong> Turn on the data set with the area of interest you want to analyze (Note: You can analyze a shape within any data set that’s made up of individual polygons – e.g, tree plantations, mining concessions, protected areas, country data sets, etc.)</p>

  <p><strong>5.</strong> Click on the shape you want to analyze and/or subscribe to.</p>
  <p><strong>ANALYZE</strong>: Click <strong>“Analyze”</strong> in the pop up window and the results will appear in the right hand side of the map. </p>

  <p>If you want to adjust the time period you are analyzing, simply drag the handles on the timeline or select a different time interval. If you want to change the type of data, you can also choose a different data set under the Forest Change menu on the map. Your results will update immediately based on your selection.</p>
  <p>You can then subscribe to the activated forest change alerts for the area by clicking the <strong>“Subscribe”</strong> button, download the data for your area of interest directly from the map (not available for all Forest Change data), or discard your analysis.</p>
  <p><strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong> Click <strong>“Subscribe”</strong> and you will be prompted to <strong>1)</strong> Log in using your Twitter, Facebook, or Google account (the first time you log in you will be prompted to create a profile), <strong>2)</strong> Enter the email address where you would like to receive notifications for the subscription, <strong>3)</strong> Name your subscription, and <strong>4)</strong> Click the link sent to your email to confirm the subscription. </p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will only be subscribed to the activated forest change data set. You can create multiple subscriptions if you would like to subscribe to more than one Forest Change data set. Please be aware that not all alert systems may cover the area you selected, and not all forest change data sets are supported by the subscription feature. To learn more about each system, click on the information icons that appear in Forest Change drop-down menu on the GFW Interactive Map.</p>
  <p>To view and manage your subscriptions, click on <strong>“Visit your saved subscriptions”</strong> in the “Subscription saved” pop-up window, or click on “Subscriptions” in the drop-down menu from the My GFW icon.</p>
