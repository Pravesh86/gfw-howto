	<p>With an ArcGIS Online organizational account, organization administrators can create an Open Data Portal and publish their data content for public access. ArcGIS Open Data provides easy search functions for finding open data and makes data available in common open formats such as geojson, csv, kml, shp, and WMS. To learn more about how to create an ArcGIS Open Data site, take a look at <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/open-data/provider/create-an-open-data-site.htm" target="_blank"> this documentation</a>.</p>
