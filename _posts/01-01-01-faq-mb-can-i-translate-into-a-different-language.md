	<p>Map Builder currently supports English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and Mandarin. You can select the default language when youâ€™re customizing your application in ArcGIS Online. Map Builder also allows you to set an alternative language if you want your application to be available in two languages.</p>
