title: Can I use this website for project-level monitoring and assessment for REDD+?

<p>While the tree cover loss and carbon emission estimates on Global Forest Watch Climate are spatially and temporally explicit, we do not advise their use for project-level assessment for REDD+, due to the scale of the carbon density data, in addition to year-to-year uncertainties in the tree cover loss data. For example, the aboveground live woody biomass density value of a single pixel may have large uncertainty when compared with small plots for verification. Therefore the forest changes visualized on the GFW Climate map should be considered indicative at best, and may require further verification from field assessment or more high-resolution imagery.</p>
