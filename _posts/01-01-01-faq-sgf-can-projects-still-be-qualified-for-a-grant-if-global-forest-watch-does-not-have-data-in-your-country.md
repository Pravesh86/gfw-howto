	<p>It depends. If your project proposes to generate data that falls under the priorities in our <a href="http://gfw.blog.s3.amazonaws.com/Data%20Playbook/GFW%20Data%20Playbook%20v3.pdf" target="_blank">Data Playbook</a>, then yes. If you are proposing to use a dataset or layer for your project, but data does not exist your area of interest, then your project will not be considered.</p>
