	<p>ArcGIS Online offers both a free public account and a paid-for organizational account. Either account gives you access to the GFW Map Builder tools, but there are a few differences that are important to note:</p>
	<p>With a free public account (which can be created <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/createaccount.html" target="_blank">here</a>.) users can create, store, and manage maps, apps and files, and share them with others. You also get access to content shared by other GIS users around the world. Public accounts are restricted to non-commercial use.</p>
	<p>Organizational accounts provide more advanced web-mapping features designed for users that work within a group, team, or organization. In addition to the public account features, organizational account users have private data and map sharing capabilities. Organizations can also create <a href="http://opendata.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">ArcGIS Open Data site</a>.</p>
