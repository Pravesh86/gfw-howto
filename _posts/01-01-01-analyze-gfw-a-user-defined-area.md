        <li>If you want to <strong>change the type of data</strong>, you can also choose a different data set under the Forest Change menu on the map. Your results will update immediately based on your selection.</li>
        <li>You can then subscribe to the activated forest change data set for the area by clicking the <strong>“Subscribe”</strong> button, download the data for your area of interest directly from the map (not available for all Forest Change data), or discard your analysis.</li>
