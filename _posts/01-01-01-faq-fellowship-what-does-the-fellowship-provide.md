	<p>The Fellowship provides opportunities for skill-building, networking and project implementation. Fellows will attend a three-day intensive technology camp in Washington, D.C., where they will receive training on GFW and other mapping tools, make connections with the GFW team and GFW partners, and receive mentorship from GFW staff. Fellows will also gain access to resources (including a program stipend) and have their work highlighted through the GFW website and other channels.</p>
