title: Why don't my plot data match pixel values in the aboveground live woody biomass density map?

<p>Almost all estimates of aboveground live woody biomass density are based on the
collection of reliable data within inventory plots on the ground, where the diameter at breast height (DBH) of individual trees is measured by field technicians at a certain point in time. These measurements are converted to tree biomass density estimates using allometric equations.</p>
<p>But because it is impractical to measure all points all the time, various methods are used to approximate forest biomass across a landscape based on a smaller sample of measurement points. Any of these approximation methods, including both statistical sampling approaches and spatial modeling approaches, are meant to provide forest biomass density estimates for an area of interest beyond what can be measured at a single point.</p>
<p>The aboveground live woody biomass density map on GFW Climate, developed by Woods Hole Research Center, reflects output from a spatial model calibrated with ground sampling points and optimized to reflect biomass distribution across all tropical forests. Each pixel value in the map may therefore not perfectly reflect biomass density measurements collected at a single point. GFW Climate provides a pixel-level uncertainty map along with the biomass density map.</p>
