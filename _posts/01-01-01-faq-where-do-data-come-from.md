<p>The data on GFW come from various sources. Most of the data are in the public domain and have been developed by governments, NGOs, research institutions, or companies. Note that the data come in different formats and vary in their accuracy, timeliness, and geographical extent. See GFWâ€™s <a href="http://gfw-nav.herokuapp.com/about/data_policy">Data policy</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Some data are produced directly by WRI and our partners, such as FORMA alerts, Intact Forest Landscapes, and some forest use data. For more details, see the <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>
