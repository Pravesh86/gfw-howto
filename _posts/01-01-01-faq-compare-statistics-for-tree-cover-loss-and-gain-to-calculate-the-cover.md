<p>Infographics on the <a href="/countries" target="_blank">Country Profiles and Rankings</a> and analysis on the <a href="/map" target="_blank">interactive map</a> allow you to view statistics for tree cover, loss, and gain, calculated using data sets from the University of Maryland/Google. Due to variation in research methodology and date of content, tree cover, loss, and gain data sets cannot be compared accurately against each other. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (or post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover.
