<div class="content">
	<p>If you want to link several GFW Map Builder applications together, copy one ArcGIS Online application ID and paste it into the "Map Theme ID" field when youâ€™re customizing another application. If you want to add multiple ids, separate them using a semicolon (;). Add a corresponding theme titles in the "Map Theme" field.</p>

  <p>If you translated your application into a second language, make sure that you also fill out the "alternativeMapThemes" field with your translated map theme titles.</p>
