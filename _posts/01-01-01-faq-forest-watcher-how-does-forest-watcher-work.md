<div class="content">
	<p>Forest Watcher displays data about forest change in “Areas of Interest,” or areas that you monitor. You can define Areas of Interest in the settings menu. If you’re part of a team, you may already have areas set up for you, which you can upload to the app. The app will then automatically download forest change data for those areas and refresh with the latest deforestation and fire alerts while you are connected to the Internet. Once you download the relevant data onto your mobile device, you can take the application offline into the field. Forest Watcher will direct you nearby alerts using the phone's internal GPS. Once you have arrived at an alert, you can fill out a report about what you find and add photos.</p>
