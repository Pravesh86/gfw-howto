	<p>Unfortunately, we can only accept applications in English <i>except</i> for applicants applying from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, and Madagascar â€“ these applicants may apply in French. Please note that we will not be able to provide a translated version of the application; applicants from these countries should submit French responses to the application in English.</p>
