title: Why isn't the biomass density map representative of a later year?

	<p>Our approach to estimating emissions from deforestation combines biomass density estimates with annual tree cover loss estimates from 2001 to 2014, both derived from spatially-explicit remote sensing imagery. This allowed us to co-locate a biomass density value with a given loss pixel. If the biomass density map were developed to be representative of a later year, e.g. 2010, then biomass density values corresponding to areas of loss in earlier years (e.g., 2001-2010) would be reflective of the cleared land after tree cover removal, rather than prior to clearing.</p>
