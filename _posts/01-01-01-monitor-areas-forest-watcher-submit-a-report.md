  <p>On Forest Watcher you can submit reports about what is happening in your area of interest. Provide photos and details by filling out a questionnaire. To submit a report for an alert or location:</p>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Select one of your areas from the Forest Watcher home page to view it on the map along with the alert data you selected. </p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> Click on an alert that you want to create a report for and a “Report” button will appear. If you click on an alert in a cluster of other alerts, you will also see an option to report on the whole group of alerts instead of just the alert you selected. </p>

  <p>If you discover something while you are out in the field, you can also create a report for a location that does not have an alert. Just tap anywhere on the map screen and the “Report” button will appear.</p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> Take a photo of the area or choose one from your photo library.</p>
