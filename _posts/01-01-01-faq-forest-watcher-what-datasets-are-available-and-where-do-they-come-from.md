	<p>There are three default datasets from Global Forest Watch provided in Forest Watcher:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>VIIRS Active Fire alerts: Produced by NASA, updated daily at 375 meter resolution. This shows you the location of suspected fires in the last week.</li>
    <li>GLAD alerts: Produced by the University of Maryland Global Land Analysis & Discovery (GLAD) Lab, updated weekly at 30 meter resolution. This show you week-by-week where forest area may have changed.</li>
    <li>Annual tree cover loss: Also produced by the GLAD lab, updated annually at 30 meter resolution. This shows you year-to-year where forest area has changed. At the moment this data is only available as a contextual data layer: you will not be able to create a report related to an annual loss alert, although you can still create a report for that location by tapping the screen at the location of the forest loss or gain.</li>
  </ul>
