	<p>GFW seeks to bring together the most current, reliable, and robust data to monitor forest change around the world. GFW incorporates and integrates a wide range of data sets that can be overlaid and compared, including:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Forest change data, such as global tree cover loss and gain data from the University of Maryland/Google, near real-time FORMA alerts for the humid tropics, SAD alerts for the Brazilian Amazon from Imazon, quarterly vegetation change data from NASA, and others</li>
		<li>Forest cover data, including global tree cover data, intact forest landscapes, and pantropical carbon density</li>
		<li>Forest fire data, from NASAâ€™s Modis satellite (see <a href='http://www.fires.globalforestwatch.org' target='_blank'>GFW Fires</a>)</li>
		<li>Forest use data, which includes contextual information, such as concession areas for natural resource extraction or agricultural production</li>
		<li>Conservation data, such as global boundaries for protected areas and biodiversity hotspots</li>
		<li>People data, including community land boundaries and land tenure rights (coming soon)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>By monitoring changes tracked by these data sets over time, users can better understand drivers and patterns of forest loss worldwide.</p>
	<p>See our <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a> for more detail. To contribute or suggest data, please <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>email</a> us.</p>
