	<p><strong>Forest</strong></p>
	<p>Various definitions exist for the term “forest,” and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus definition. Data sets hosted on GFW may define “forest” differently or pertain to different types of forest (primary, secondary, tree plantations, etc.). Through information found on the <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a>, we aim to be transparent about the assumptions and definitions feeding into each data set.</p>
	<p>In our general writing, including the GFW blog, “forest” refers to a landscape with a high density of trees and value for biodiversity, carbon storage, and human use..</p>

	<p><strong>Deforestation</strong></p>
	<p>How one defines “deforestation” depends on how one defines “forest.” As noted above, various definitions of forest exist and GFW does not aim to provide a consensus view. Correspondingly, GFW does not provide a single definition for “deforestation.”</p>
	<p>In general writing, GFW uses “deforestation” to refer to the removal of a significant number of trees from a landscape, typically in the context of human actions rather than natural events such as fires or disease. We generally refer to “gross deforestation” (the total amount of forest loss), rather than “net deforestation” (the total amount of forest loss minus the amount of forest gain), or clearly specify otherwise.</p>
	<p>For more information on each data set, please visit our <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>Tree cover</strong></p>
	<p>Where found on the GFW website, “tree cover” refers to the biophysical presence of trees, which may be part of natural forests or tree plantations. The inclusion of all types of tree plantations in the “tree cover” definition notably distinguishes the term from some definitions of “forest.” Accordingly, “tree cover” and “forest” should not be used interchangeably. Different data sets further define “tree cover” with added parameters (see the <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a> for details and distinctions).</p>

	<p><strong>Tree cover loss</strong></p>
	<p>“Tree cover loss” refers to the removal of trees, which may be within natural forests or tree plantations. Accordingly, “tree cover loss” does not necessarily equate to “deforestation” and can result from a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. Different data sets have additional parameters that must be met for the indication or alert of loss to appear on the GFW map (see examples below).</p>

	<ul>
	<li><strong>University of Maryland (UMD)/Google tree cover loss:</strong> Loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal or mortality of tree cover canopy (of any canopy cover density) at the Landsat pixel scale (30 × 30 meters).</li>

	<li><strong>FORMA alerts:</strong> Loss alerts are triggered by areas exhibiting a steep, persistent drop in vegetation intensity, indicating a high probability (equal to or greater than 50%) of the occurrence of tree cover loss. It is important to note that this alert-based system is not the same as an area measurement of tree cover loss.</li>
	</ul>
