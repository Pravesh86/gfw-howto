<div class="content">
	<p>Analyses can be run on any shape inside the web map or polygons drawn or uploaded by a user. Select the type of analysis you want to run using the dropdown menu in the analysis tab.</p>

	<p>By default we currently support analysis for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Total tree cover loss and tree cover gain</li>
    <li>Annual tree cover loss</li>
    <li>Tree cover loss per land cover class</li>
    <li>Tree cover loss inside intact forest landscapes</li>
    <li>Annual carbon emissions due to tree cover loss</li>
    <li>Active fires</li>
    <li>Land cover composition</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In the future we plan to add analysis for the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recent GLAD alerts</li>
    <li>Recent FORMA alters</li>
    <li>Recent Terra-I alerts</li>
    <li>Recent SAD-Imazon alerts</li>
    <li>Palm Oil suitability</li>
	</ul>
