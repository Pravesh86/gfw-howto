  <p><strong>2.</strong> Click on the Settings tab at the top of the page.</p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> You will see information about your teams under “My team”.</p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If someone you want to add to your team has not used MyGFW yet, he or she must go to www.globalforestwatch.org and set up a MyGFW account first. Make sure that the email you use to invite them to join a team is the same email they used to set up their profile on MyGFW. You can only be on one Forest Watcher team per email account.</p>
