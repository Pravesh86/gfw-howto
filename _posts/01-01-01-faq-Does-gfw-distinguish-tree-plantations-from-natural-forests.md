	<p>Tree plantations are not distinguished from natural forests in the case of several key data sets hosted on GFW (including 2000 tree cover, UMD/Google tree cover loss and gain, FORMA alerts, and QUICC alerts). Tree cover loss may include cases of tree plantations being harvested, and tree cover gain may include cases where natural forests are replaced with tree plantations.</p>

	<p>It is nonetheless important to <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/805.full' target='_blank'>distinguish</a> between natural forests and tree plantations when considering conservation, carbon storage, and value to local communities. Natural forests have higher biodiversity, store more carbon, and are more often associated with the traditional livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. Accordingly, GFW and partners are developing a “plantation forests map” for the tropical regions to determine the location of plantations on a near-global scale. The map, developed through remote sensing methods, will be coming soon to GFW.</p>
