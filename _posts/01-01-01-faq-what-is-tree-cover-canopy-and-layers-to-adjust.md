title: What is tree cover canopy (TCC) density and what layers allow me to adjust it?

<p>Not all forests have the same footprint. Some forests are dense, like the tropical Amazon, with canopies that blanket almost every inch of ground for miles. Others forests are sparse, such as the savannah woodlands of North Africa where the canopies do not close or interlace. There are many shades in between. As a result, there is no global consensus on how much tree cover is needed to constitute a forest and it is important to be able to adjust the tree cover canopy density according to different user or country definitions of “forest.”</p>

<p>The minimum tree cover canopy density can only be adjusted within the UMD/Google tree cover and loss data sets. When these layers are activated in the map, you can adjust the minimum percentage of canopy density through the settings icon. This adjustment can also be made in other areas of the website where UMD/Google forest statistics are used, such as within the country profiles and rankings.</p>

<p>What do these percentages mean? Technically speaking, tree cover canopy density represents the estimated percent of a pixel that was covered by tree canopy in the year 2000, as determined from the analysis of satellite imagery. For the tree cover loss data, tree cover canopy density therefore corresponds to the density of tree cover before loss occurred. For example, if you select 25% as the minimum tree cover canopy density, you will only see tree cover loss pixels for which the original tree cover density was greater than 25%.</p>

<p>Note: Adjustments to the minimum TCC density only affect UMD tree cover loss and extent data layers. This feature does not pertain to UMD tree cover gain or to other GFW data layers or statistics. UMD tree cover gain is displayed with a set minimum TCC density greater than 50%. The minimum TCC density cannot be changed independently for loss and extent. A change made to one data layer will immediately take effect in the other.</p>
