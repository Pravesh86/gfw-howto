	<p>Yes, you can analyze your own shapefile by uploading it into a Map Builder application. Make sure that your data is stored using WGS1984 as spatial reference. Compress your shapefile and its corresponding .shx, .dbf and .prj file in a ZIP file, and upload it into your application using the drawing tool in the toolbox section. Avoid uploading very complex shapefiles or shapefiles with too many features as they might cause the application to crash.</p>
