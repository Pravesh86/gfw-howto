  <h5>I don’t see any alert data?</h5>
  <p>If you don’t see any alerts in your Area of Interest, check globalforestwatch.org to see if there is data for that location and the timeframe you chose. If there are no recent GLAD or VIIRS alerts, then there has been no recent forest change activity. Consider using the Annual Tree Cover Change contextual layer to find older loss alerts, which could still inform an investigation or field visit.</p>
  
  <h5>The app crashes?</h5>
  <p>If the app crashes, open it again. If it crashes multiple times, please send an email to <a href="mailto:forestwatcher@wri.org">forestwatcher@wri.org</a> and include information about your device model and what you were doing in the app when it crashed. </p>
  
  <h5>I can’t see the compass/my location?</h5>
  <p>The location and navigation features on Forest Watcher rely on your device’s internal GPS. First, check that the GPS (often called “location services”) is turned on in your mobile device settings. If it still doesn’t work, please send an email to <a href="mailto:forestwatcher@wri.org">forestwatcher@wri.org</a> telling us what device model you are using.</p>
  
  <h5>I cannot take a photo in the app?</h5>
  <p>Some devices that only have front facing cameras may not be compatible with the camera in the report form. You can instead take a photo on your camera app, and use the upload function in the report in Forest Watcher to add a photo from your library to the report. </p>
  
  <h5>I want to complete a report later?</h5>
  <p>You may not always be able to complete a report right at the scene of an alert. You can start writing a report, save it, and return to it later when you are back at your base. You can also take a picture just using your device’s camera, then fill out the report later on: you can attach the picture to your report.</p>
  
  <h5>Alerts are slow to load?</h5>
  <p>When you first set up Forest Watcher on your mobile device, the app will need to download a lot of data to work offline. You may need to wait about 5 minutes for all the data to load properly. This is normal. If you have a weak or slow internet connection, this can make the download take longer. Keep the app open to allow the download to complete. After the initial set up, new alert data will download every time you connect your device to the internet - the download time will vary depending on how many alerts have occurred. These updates would be on the scale of Kilobytes, where the initial download will likely be a few Megabytes.</p>
  
  <h5>I want to see GLAD alerts and VIIRS for the same Area of Interest?</h5>
  <p>At the moment you can only view one dataset at a time for each Area of Interest. The dataset you are looking at for each Area of Interest is controlled using the settings menu. If you want to look at both fires data and forest loss data for the same place, you will need to create two Areas of Interest for the same location and set up each of them to download the different datasets.</p>
  
  <h5>I run out of memory on my device?</h5>
  <p>Forest Watcher contains a lot of data and could take up a lot of memory on your device, depending on how many Areas of Interest you have, how big they are and how many alerts there are in each one. We recommend having at least 16GB of internal storage on your device, so you can use your other apps as well as Forest Watcher: Forest Watcher won’t need all of this storage. The fewer, smaller areas of interest you set up in the app, the less data will need to be downloaded onto your device.</p>

  <h5>I want to collect custom data?</h5>
  <p>You can use Forest Watcher Desktop to create a custom form template for your team to use when collecting data. You can also add notes in the final section of the form if you have observations you want to make.</p>
