	<p>Audits are strongly encouraged. However, if your organization does not have an audit, you will need to be able to provide all three of the following documents:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>a balance sheet for the most current and previous year;</li>
    <li>an income statement for the most current and previous year;</li>
    <li>a cash flow statement for the most current and previous year.</li>
  </ol>
