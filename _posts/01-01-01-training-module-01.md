  <p>These courses are designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the ways GFW can support a variety of professional fields overlapping with environmental change, forests, and biodiversity. These educational resources combine existing GFW materials, learning activities, and knowledge from across the GFW partnership.</p>
  <p><a href="http://bit.ly/GFW-education" target="_blank">Teacher Training Module</a>: This module helps educators contextualize environmental issues discussed in class by giving students an interactive learning tool that visualizes forest information in a clear, compelling way.</p>
  <p>Additional training modules are coming soon.</p>
