	<p>GFW Map Builder supports up to two languages for any application. You can select the default language when you are customizing your application in ArcGIS Online. If you want to add a second language, check the "additional language" box and select your alternative language from the dropdown menu. The default user interface as well as all GFW data layers will be translated. However, you will need to translate all custom text that you add, including the title, subtitle, narrative, and data menu. If you want to translate data layers and metadata for your alternative language, you can also create a second, translated web map in ArcGIS Online and add the web map ID in the corresponding field.</p>
