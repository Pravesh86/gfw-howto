<div class="content">
	<p>By default Map Builder uses the GlobCover global land cover map for land cover analysis. If you want to use another land cover map you will need to set up a custom service, since all analyses are run through the server, not in the browser. GFW Map Builder allows you to swap out the land cover map and the underlying service for the analysis. If you are interested using your own land cover map, please contact us <a href="mailto:gfw-mapbuilder@wri.org">here</a> and we can assist in preparing your data for analysis.</p>
