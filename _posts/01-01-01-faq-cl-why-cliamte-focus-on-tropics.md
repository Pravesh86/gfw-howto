<div class="content">
	<p>Monitoring greenhouse gas fluxes from forests is complex. When building GFW Climate, it was necessary to start somewhere. Through our outreach and interactions with stakeholders and other interested parties, it was clear that deforestation in the tropics was where there was the highest interest and need for an independent monitoring tool.. As we move forward, it is our intention to move beyond the tropics and beyond only deforestation.</p>
