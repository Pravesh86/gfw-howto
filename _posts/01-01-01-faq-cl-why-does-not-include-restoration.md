	<p>Forest regrowth often occurs slowly over many years, and requires continued monitoring using high resolution satellite imagery for an accurate depiction of gains in tree cover. Although the original University of Maryland and Google data set includes a global tree cover gain layer for 2000-2012, the data set cannot distinguish between natural regeneration and the establishment of plantations, such as those for timber harvesting and agricultural cultivation (oil palm, rubber, etc.). In the absence of a consistent and accurate global forest regrowth data set, GFW Climate has chosen to focus instead on emissions due to forest loss, for which up-to-date global and national data exist.</p>
