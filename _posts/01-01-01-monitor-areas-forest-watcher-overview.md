  <p>Forest Watcher is a mobile application that lets you bring the forest monitoring and alert systems of Global Forest Watch offline and into the field. The <a href="http://fw.globalforestwatch.org" target="_blank">Forest Watcher desktop website</a> provides additional features like creating custom report templates and setting up teams to monitor areas.</p>
  <h4>STEPS FOR USING FOREST WATCHER</h4>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Download the Forest Watcher app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.forestwatcher" target="_blank">Google Play</a> or the Apple App store. Make sure that your device meets the technical requirements. The app works best if you are connected to a wifi network, but you can also use your cellular data. Forest Watcher will always ask you before using your cellular data to load alerts.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The app is available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or Indonesian. You can change the language in the app settings.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> Log in using your Facebook, Twitter, or Google account. If you already use MyGFW on Global Forest Watch, we recommend that you log in using the same account.</p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/howto/monitor-areas/set-up-an-area-of-interest.html" target="_blank">Set up an area to monitor</a> and load the latest alerts. You can also <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/howto/monitor-areas/manage-areas-of-interest.html" target="_blank">set up and manage areas of interest on the Forest Watcher website</a> and they will sync with the mobile app as long as you log in with the same account.</p>
  <p><strong>4.</strong> <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/howto/monitor-areas/monitor-alerts-and-navigate-to-an-area.html" target="_blank">Monitor your area for alerts</a> by viewing it on the map.
