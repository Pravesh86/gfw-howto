<div class="content">
	<p>You can publish both vector and raster data. However, you can only run analyses in GFW Map Builder with vector data.</p>

	<p>The following formats are supported for vector data:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Shapefiles</li>
  	<li>KML</li>
  	<li>GeoJSON</li>
  	<li>ESRI Map Service</li>
  	<li>ESRI Feature Service</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following formats are supported for raster data:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>WMS</li>
  	<li>Image Service</li>
  	<li>Tile Package</li>
	</ul>
  <p>If you donâ€™t have the option to host data as WMS or Image Service yourself, the preferred format for raster data is Tile Packages.
