<p>Please first ensure that you are using an appropriate web browser. We recommend using a recent version of <a href='https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/' target='_blank'>Google Chrome</a>, <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/' target='_blank'>Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href='http://www.apple.com/safari/' target='_blank'>Apple Safari</a>, or <a href='http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie' target='_blank'>Internet Explorer</a>. We also recommend that you install <a href='http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/' target='_blank'>Adobe Flash Player</a> before using the GFW website.</p>

<p>If errors persist when using a recommended browser, please let us know through the <a href='http://www.globalforestwatch.org/?show_feedback=true'>feedback form</a>, contact us at <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.org'>gfw@wri.org</a>, or <a href='https://github.com/vizzuality/gfw/issues?state=open' target='_blank'>submit an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>GFW is still in “beta,” which means that there may still be some minor issues and errors within the site. We are usually able to fix them in a timely manner. It is helpful if you send us a link to the page or data set you had open when you encountered the problem, and if you tell us which browser you are using. You can also view the <a href='http://stats.pingdom.com/me0q72oj01nt' target='_blank'>Global Forest Watch System Status</a> page to see if there are any portions of the website that are not working properly. If you want to give us general feedback or suggestions about new data or functionality, please visit the <a href="/getinvolved/provide-feedback" target='_blank'>Feedback page</a>.</p>
