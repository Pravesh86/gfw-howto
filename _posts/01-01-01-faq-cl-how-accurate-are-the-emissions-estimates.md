<p>The accuracy of emissions estimates varies, due to estimation errors inherent in the input data. Along with the aboveground live woody biomass density values, users can view an error map at the same spatial resolution, which provides the level of uncertainty for this data layer. It is recommended that both aboveground carbon density and uncertainty values be used together for carbon assessments and verification. The map will provide accurate estimates of aboveground carbon stocks and aboveground carbon density when aggregated to large areas (5,000 to 10,000 ha) for project and regional level assessments. The biomass density value of a single pixel may have large uncertainty when compared with small plots for verification. In addition, there may be year-to-year uncertainties in the loss data. Hansen et al (2013) are 75 percent confident that the loss occurred within the stated year, and 97 percent confident that it occurred within a period from the year before to the year after the stated year.</p>
