	<p>The Map Builder template is built in ArcGIS Online because ArcGIS makes it easy to create and share custom web maps and applications. ArcGIS Online supports many GIS formats, including Shapefiles, KML and GeoJSON as well as MapService, ImageService and WMS. It is a robust mapping platform with guaranteed long-term support and provides an easy to use mapping environment where anyone can create a web map with only a couple of clicks.</p>
