    Yes. As the focus for the 2019 cycle is on using near real time data for enforcement and advocacy, eligible countries are limited to those that have weekly GLAD alerts available. See the <a href="https://blog.globalforestwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Guidelines-for-SGF-Applicants-2019.pdf">2019 Guideline for Applicants</a> for a list of eligible countries.
