<p>GFW aims to provide data with global coverage, but this isnâ€™t always possible. The geographic coverage of each data set is described on the <a href="http://data.globalforestwatch.org/">Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

<p>Data may have limited coverage for various reasons. GFW works to incorporate new data as quickly as possible as they are made available. If you know of a publicly available data set that we do not have, please <a href='mailto:gfw@wri.com'>contact us</a> to let us know.</p>
