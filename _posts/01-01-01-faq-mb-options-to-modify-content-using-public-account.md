<div class="content">
	<p>With a public ArcGIS Online account you can customize your web map application in the same way as with an organizational account. The only difference is that the public account doesn't allow you to register your own application templates. This means that using the public account you don't have the same publishing experience as with an organizational account and can't use the publication widget and the web form to modify the application. Instead you will have to customize your application using <a href="https://github.com/wri/gfw-mapbuilder/blob/dev-wri/config-panels/simplePanel.json" target="_blank"> this JSON object</a> and attach it as “Configuration Parameters” in your application. The entire publishing workflow for public accounts is described <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org/howto/tutorial-videos/tutorial-map-builder-build-a-custom-web-app-in-arcgis.html">here</a>.</p>
