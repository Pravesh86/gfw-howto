<div class="content">
	<p>GFW aims to radically improve the availability, quality, and accessibility of forest data for everyone:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Governments</strong> can use GFW to detect illegal forest clearing and target forest law enforcement efforts.</li>
	  <li><strong>NGOs & civil society</strong> can identify deforestation hotspots and bolster their investigations, advocacy, and campaigns.</li>
	  <li><strong>Indigenous communities</strong> can monitor their territories and raise an alarm when their customary forests are threatened.</li>
	  <li><strong>Media</strong> can gather evidence, data, and graphics for reporting.</li>
	  <li><strong>Researchers</strong> can analyze forest trends on a local or global scale and better understand the causes of forest change.</li>
	  <li><strong>Concerned citizens everywhere</strong> can learn more about the state of forests and participate in forest monitoring. Students and educators can learn more about forests at local and global scales.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>GFW also brings together a dynamic community of partners with expertise in forest science, conservation, supply chain management, web development, citizen science, community outreach, and in-depth knowledge of priority forests around the world.</p>
