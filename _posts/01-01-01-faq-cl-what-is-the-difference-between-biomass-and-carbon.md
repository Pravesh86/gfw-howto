<div class="content">
	<p>The carbon content of woody matter (stem, branches and roots) and leaves is approximately 50% of their total weight, or biomass. Multiplying the total biomass by the proportion of that biomass 
	which is carbon gets us to an estimate of the total amount of carbon stored in a tree.</p>
