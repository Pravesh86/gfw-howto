	<p>Fellows who have successfully completed the fellowship will continue to be alumni of the fellowship program and part of the GFW Partnership, which includes an invitation to the biennial GFW Partnership Meeting and User Summit. Funds pending, we would also like for alumni to mentor new cohorts of fellows, and provide microgrants so that they can continue activities.</p>
