  <p>In the ODP you can <a href="http://doc.arcgis.com/en/open-data/consumer/access-data.htm">download data</a> with one-click and choose from multiple download formats such as .csv, .shp, KML, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and API. The ODP makes it easy to quickly access GFW data and add them to your favorite tools including, but not limited to, ArcMap, ArcGIS Online, Google Earth, ERDAS Imagine, and Excel.</p>
  <p>Once a search is executed, you can download a data set from the results page by selecting the “download” icon on the right-hand side of the results page. Larger and more detailed data sets will take longer to download.</p>

  <p>You can also select a data set from the results page to view its profile page. From a profile page you can select “DOWNLOAD DATASET” and choose your download format. The download drop-down will also provide an option to “Download Filtered Dataset,” determined by a map or attribute filter.</p>
