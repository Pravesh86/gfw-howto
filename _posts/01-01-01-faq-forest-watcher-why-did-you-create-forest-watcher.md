	<p>Forest Watcher was first developed by the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), Google, Touchlab and Global Forest Watch. Village forest monitors, protected area rangers and local communities working with the Jane Goodall Institute needed to access up-to-date satellite data for forest monitoring; however, internet access is limited in the remote areas where they work. Without this information, forest monitors could miss deforestation activity occurring beyond their patrol routes. JGI, GFW, Touchlab, Vizzuality and Google created Forest Watcher to enable access to GFW data offline while in the field.</p>
