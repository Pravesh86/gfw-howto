  <p>Once you have set up your area of interest, you can begin to investigate alerts.</p>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Select one of your areas from the Forest Watcher home page to view it on the map along with the alert data you selected.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> You will see alerts as pink pixels within your area. A circle with a number indicates the number of alerts in a location. Click on this circle to automatically zoom closer to the alerts.</p>

  <p><strong>3.</strong> To select an alert, click on a pixel and it will turn white. If there are other alerts nearby, they will show up as highlighted, suggesting that you consider them as a group. To unselect an alert, click on it again.</p>

  <p><strong>4.</strong> If you are near your area, you can start navigating towards an alert or location on the map. You will see a green circle on the screen showing your current location. Next to that circle you’ll see a white arrow indicating the direction you’re currently looking. Click on an alert or a location in your area to see how far away you are from it.</p>

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: You must allow Forest Watcher to access GPS/location data from your mobile device in order for this feature to work.</p>
  <p><strong>5.</strong> When you have selected an alert, you will see a “Report” button appear. <a href="http://globalforestwatch.org/howto/monitor-areas/submit-a-report.html" target="_blank">Learn how to submit a report</a>.</p>
