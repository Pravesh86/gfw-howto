title: Do GFW data reveal the quality of forest management (e.g., sustainable versus unsustainable)? What about forest change from natural versus human causes?

<p>The forest change data displayed on GFW (such as UMD/Google tree cover loss and FORMA alerts) do not necessarily distinguish the quality of the forest management (e.g., sustainable or unsustainable), the legality (illegal or legal), or the cause (e.g., natural or human) of forest change events. For example, the forest change data available on GFW will include forest change from tree harvesting, fires, pests, and forest clearing for agriculture.</p>

<p>However, contextual data available on GFW can help users draw more informed conclusions about the nature and drivers of forest change events. For example, users can overlay forest change data over the protected areas layer to flag areas of potential concern. Or users can pull up satellite imagery base maps to look for “burnscars,” “blowdowns,” logging roads, and so on.</p>
