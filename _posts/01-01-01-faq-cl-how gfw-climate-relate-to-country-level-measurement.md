	<p>The establishment of robust MRV systems for REDD+ is a key component in the successful implementation of carbon emissions reduction strategies. Global Forest Watch Climate is not intended to replace country-led MRV efforts, which should include much more detailed information on the greenhouse gas impacts of planned or implemented policies and measures. However, GFW Climate can be used as an independent tool against which forest reference emissions levels and other nationally-reported estimates can be assessed.</p>
